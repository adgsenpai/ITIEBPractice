## ✅ Success Checklist

Before the exam, ensure you can:

- [ ] Create classes with private fields
- [ ] Write parameterized constructors
- [ ] Implement accessor methods (getters)
- [ ] Define and use class constants
- [ ] Write toString methods with correct formatting
- [ ] Read data from text files
- [ ] Handle file I/O errors
- [ ] Store objects in arrays
- [ ] Loop through arrays to process data
- [ ] Filter data based on conditions
- [ ] Calculate aggregates (sums, averages, counts)
- [ ] Work with dates and date calculations
- [ ] Create user interface classes
- [ ] Call manager methods from UI

## 🔧 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. ❌ Making fields public instead of private
2. ❌ Not checking if files exist before opening
3. ❌ Forgetting to update array counter variables
4. ❌ Using wrong toString format (spaces instead of tabs)
5. ❌ Not handling edge cases (empty strings, null values)
6. ❌ Hardcoding the current date in calculations
7. ❌ Using built-in sort/search (must code from scratch per IEB rules)
8. ❌ Poor time management during the exam
9. ❌ Not testing code with provided data
10. ❌ Skipping question instructions

## 📊 Mark Distribution

Understanding mark allocation helps prioritize effort:

| Question | Marks | Key Focus |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Q2 | 13 | Simple class, constructor, accessors, toString |
| Q3 | 20 | Complex class, constants, conditional logic |
| Q4 | 31 | **File I/O (15), arrays, filtering (6), toString (6)** |
| Q5 | 4 | UI creation and method calls |
| **Total** | **68** | **Focus most on Q4 file I/O!** |
