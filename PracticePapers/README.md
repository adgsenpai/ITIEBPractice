   - Test your complete solution

4. **Review Your Code**
   - Check for proper encapsulation (private fields)
   - Verify toString methods format correctly
   - Ensure file I/O handles errors
   - Test edge cases

## üí° Key Concepts to Master

### Essential OOP Principles

1. **Encapsulation**
   - All fields should be `private`
   - Access through `public` methods only

2. **Constructor Patterns**
   - Initialize all fields
   - Handle validation in constructors
   - Use conditional assignment when needed

3. **Accessor Methods (Getters)**
   ```java
   public String getName() {
       return name;
   }
   ```

4. **Class Constants**
   ```java
   public static final int CATEGORY_A = 1;
   ```

5. **toString Method**
   - Format: `field1<tab>field2<tab>field3`
   - Use `\t` for tabs

### File I/O Pattern

Every manager class should:
```
1. Check if file exists
2. Display error if not found
3. Open file for reading
4. Read first N lines (hardcoded number OK)
5. Create objects and add to array
6. Read remaining lines
7. Create objects and add to second array
8. Close file
```

### Common Calculations

- **Percentage**: `(value / total) * 100`
- **Days between dates**: Use built-in date methods
- **Years between dates**: `currentYear - startYear`
- **Counting occurrences**: Loop through array, increment counter
- **Summing values**: Loop through array, accumulate total

## üéì Programming Language Notes

These practice papers use **language-neutral pseudocode** that can be implemented in:

- **Java** (most common for IEB)
- **Delphi/Pascal**

### Key Differences to Remember

| Concept | Java | Delphi |
|---------|------|--------|
| Private field | `private String name;` | `name: String;` |
| Constructor | `public ClassName(...)` | `constructor Create(...);` |
| toString | `public String toString()` | `function ToString: String;` |
| Array | `ClassName[] arr = new ClassName[100];` | `arr: array[0..99] of ClassName;` |
| Date | `Date` or `LocalDate` | `TDateTime` |

## üîß Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Making fields public** - Always use `private`
2. **Not checking if file exists** - Always validate before opening
3. **Hardcoding array sizes in loops** - Use the counter variable
4. **Not updating counter variables** - Increment after adding to array
5. **Wrong toString format** - Use tabs (`\t`), not spaces
6. **Forgetting to handle edge cases** - Check for empty strings, division by zero
7. **Using built-in sort/search** - Develop from first principles as per IEB rules
8. **Not reading the WHOLE question** - Miss important details
9. **Poor time management** - Spend too long on one question
10. **Not testing with provided data** - Always verify your solution works

---

## üìù Sample Data Files

Each practice paper includes sample data at the end of the file. To use:

1. Copy the sample data section
2. Create a new text file with the specified name (e.g., `LibraryData.txt`)
3. Paste the data
4. Ensure the file is in the correct location for your IDE
5. Run your solution

**Data Format**: Fields are separated by `#` character
**Date Format**: `yyyy MM dd` (space-separated)

## üéØ Exam Day Tips

1. **Read instructions carefully** - Note any specific requirements
2. **Check which database/language** - Use the correct syntax
3. **Look at all data files** - Understand the structure before coding
4. **Plan before coding** - Think about data structures
5. **Test incrementally** - Don't wait until the end
6. **Comment problematic code** - If it doesn't work, comment it out
7. **Save frequently** - Don't lose your work
8. **Leave time for printing** - Ensure code is legible and formatted
